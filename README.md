## Usage
A user is presented an input box and told to enter a city name.
Once a city name is entered, the user is presented with the current and 5 day weather forecast for that city.
If a user does not enter a city name and clicks on the submit button, the user is prompted to enter a city name.
The user can also see history searches and view weather conditions for those history searches. This will help the user plan his/her daily trips
